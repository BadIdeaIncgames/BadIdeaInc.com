    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>Here at BadIdeaInc games are the name of the - well... game.</p>
    <p>As a solo indie developer, BadIdeaInc tackles a wide range of concepts including: design, narrative, programming and music. I am especially passionate about telling a good story and create games driven by this. These games tend to be tongue-and-cheek (mostly an extension of my personality) with general chaos abound.</p>
    <p>Dreams are big (and controlled by a celestial cat but we won't get into that here). At the moment BadIdeaInc is trying to put it's foot in the door, like a mysterious stranger rolling into the Saloon. BadIdeaInc before anything else has direction and plans, with time as the sails.</p>
    <p>All that is really left to say is stay tuned...</p>
